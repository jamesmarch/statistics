                    <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
                        <p>The study of statistics was my first true foray into critical thinking. As an undergraduate psychology major, little of what I was taught in my freshman and sophmore years emphasized questioning the pre-constructed notions of our built environments. It wasn't until a couple of semesters later in an advanced multivariate statistics course—taught by the incredible Dr. Gerard Martin—that I entered into a mode of thinking that forever changed the way I see life.</p>

                         <h4>“In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.”</h4>


                        <p>Knowing this, how do we make sense of our world? The answer comes into form within the formation of our tools, from the physical to the mental and spatial. Math, geometry, physics, sociology, art, religion—among many others. Disciplines of invention and innovation. Modes of assessing, analysizing and creating new ideas and possiblities for humans. Out of all of these areas, statistics does a great job at marrying stringent analysis with creativity, imagination and critical thinking.</p>

                        <p>Studying statistics provides you with an internal toolkit that you need in order to react intelligently to information you hear or read. It also makes you more attuned to how many pieces of information you take as fact, when in reality, a fair amount of information that you hear and use is not based in fact at all. Is aspartame bad for you? How do you know that? Oh yeah, really? How robust were the results of those studies? Are there outside politics involved? Are all chemicals bad for you just because they're not natural? What is a <em>natural</em> food? This is in no way defense of consuming the chemical aspartame. What I hope to show are the many considerations one must have before before assertively agreeing with a claim.</p></div>

  <p>Statistics are often presented in an effort to add credibility to an argument or advice. You can see this by paying attention to television advertisements. Many of the numbers thrown about in this way do not represent careful statistical analysis. It's also better to have a critical understanding of how studies get published and how they may lack credibiity. For these reasons and many others, learning about statistics is a long step towards taking control of your decision-making and <strong>problem-solving</strong> abilities. </p>

                            <p>So, how can this help you as a designer? Here are a few things to consider:


                                <h5>Understanding data will help you make good design choices.</h5>
                                <p> Instead of making decisions <em>because it looks cool</em>, you will have an arsenal of discourse to reinforce your decisions. Data science is being used in many large organizations now as a fundamental basis of enacting iterative changes to interfaces and experiences. Hop on the train early to underatanding this side of the coin. </p>

                                <h5>Knowing about statistics will make you more legimitimate in the eyes of your collaborators.</h5>
                                <p>Marketers and executives in businesses will often try and use statistics to formulate resilience against big changes to projects. If you're able to question data with carefully crafted response, coupled with an understanding of metrics, you will be perceived as more persuasive and legitimate than someone who just "<em>picks a few colour and makes things fancy.</em>"


                                    <h5>Data can be used as a form of content.</h5>
                                    <p>The rise of the information design discipline didn't happen by accident. An emergence of technological possibility and an increased desire for seeing the bigger picture has enabled data-driven design projects to come to the forefront of periodicals and publications. Knowing how to use data as a content driver can potentially make the difference between starting at a menial junior position making posters for a printing company versus working at a mature start-up that has flexible hours, unlimited vacation, and comfy chairs.</p>

                                    <h5>Statistics heightens your critical awareness of the world around you.</h5>
                                    <p>Not accepting things "as they are" is perhaps the best mode of thinkig to be in as a designer. Thinking about how to make a product or experience better and carrying out that execution comprises the very nature of being a designer. </p>



<p>Do not think even for a second that statistics is simply all about numbers. I consider statistics to be something like the poetry of mathmatics. It's moreso about seeing numbers and data and creating a dialogue around it. What did we discover? What does it mean? What else can  it mean? Is there something further we can learn here? What else can we look into? The questions will go on and on, and that, my friends, is the beauty of it all.</p>
