                        <p>This one's a doozy, so please bear with me.</p>

                        <p>A statistical hypothesis is an assumption about a population you're studying. This assumption may or may not be true, so you perform a statistical to see if there is data to support or refute your assumption.</p>

                        <p>The best way to determine whether a statistical hypothesis is true would be to examine the entire population. Since evaluating an entire population is usually out of our pay grades (or we would rather watch Netflix than mindlessly do something that is impractical), researchers will typically examine a <strong>random</strong> sample from the population. If sample data are not consistent with the statistical hypothesis, the hypothesis is rejected.</p>

                        <p>There are two types of statistical hypotheses:</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <h5>Null Hypothesis</h5>
                            <p>The hypothesis that sample observations result purely from chance, not because of the variables involved. </blockquote>


                        <blockquote>
                            <h5>Alternative hypothesis</h5>
                            <p>The hypothesis that sample observations are influenced by some non-random cause. For example, suppose we wanted to determine whether a coin was fair and balanced. A null hypothesis might be that half the flips would result in Heads and half, in Tails. The alternative hypothesis might be that the number of Heads and Tails would be very different. </p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>Suppose we flipped the coin 50 times, resulting in 40 Heads and 10 Tails. Given this result, we would be inclined to reject the null hypothesis. We would conclude, based on the evidence, that the coin was probably not fair and balanced.</p>

                        <h5>Can We Accept the Null Hypothesis?</h5>



                        <p>Some researchers say that a hypothesis test can have one of two outcomes: you accept the null hypothesis or you reject the null hypothesis. Many statisticians, however, take issue with the notion of <em>accepting the null hypothesis</em>. Instead, they say: you reject the null hypothesis or you fail to reject the null hypothesis.</p>

                        <p>Why the distinction between "acceptance" and "failure to reject?" Acceptance implies that the null hypothesis is true. Failure to reject implies that the data are not sufficiently persuasive for us to prefer the alternative hypothesis over the null hypothesis. Remember in <a href="index.html">my introductory essay</a>, truth (or the search for it) is a fundamental principle of statistical philosophy.</p>

                    <p>When you perform a hypothesis test in statistics, a p-value helps you determine the significance of your results. Hypothesis tests are used to test the validity of a claim that is made about a population. This claim that’s on trial, in essence, is called the null hypothesis.</p>

                    <p>The alternative hypothesis is the one you would believe if the null hypothesis is concluded to be untrue. The evidence in the trial is your data and the statistics that go along with it. All hypothesis tests ultimately use a p-value to weigh the strength of the evidence (what the data are telling you about the population). The p-value is a number between 0 and 1 and interpreted in the following way:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="text-italic">A small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="text-italic">A large p-value (> 0.05) indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you fail to reject the null hypothesis.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="text-italic">p-values very close to the cutoff (0.05) are considered to be marginal (could go either way). Always report the p-value so your readers can draw their own conclusions.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>For example, suppose a pizza place claims their delivery times are 30 minutes or less on average but you think it’s more than that. You conduct a hypothesis test because you believe the null hypothesis, that the mean delivery time is 30 minutes max, is incorrect. Your alternative hypothesis is that the mean time is greater than 30 minutes. You randomly sample some delivery times and run the data through the hypothesis test, and your p-value turns out to be 0.001, which is much less than 0.05.</p>

                    <p>In real terms, there is a probability of 0.001 that you will mistakenly reject the pizza place’s claim that their delivery time is less than or equal to 30 minutes. Since typically we are willing to reject the null hypothesis when this probability is less than 0.05, you conclude that the pizza place is wrong; their delivery times are in fact more than 30 minutes on average, and you want to know what they’re gonna do about it! (Of course, you could be wrong by having sampled an unusually high number of late pizza deliveries just by chance.)</p>

                    <P>Degrees of freedom (df) relate to the number of values in the final calculation of a statistic that are free to vary. I could do an entire chapter on this topic (and will evenually). For now, just know that the larger the degrees of freedom, the more underdtanding of the variance there is amongst the data. Larger degrees of freedom, then, means we will have more stable results. Let's make both of these numbers also 10.</P>

                    <p>With all 10s, we receive a p-value of .001. We can, with a fair degree of confiendence, reject the null hypothesis and state that the data show the variables help result in the differences between the groups. In other words, our hypothesis was correct.</p>
                    <p>What if we drop the degree of freedom to 2? Well, we kow much less about our variance now, so as a result, we receive a non-significant p-value of .091.</p>

                    <p>If we lower the <em>F</em> even to something like 3, our p-value goes up a large amount (.25).You can see here how significant is governed by just a few numbers, but how these numbers are obtained are loaded with tons of qualitative sensitivities.</p>
